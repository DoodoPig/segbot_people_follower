/*This is the documentation for the People detection using Kinect, supported under ROS Hydro and Ubuntu 12.04, Created and maintained by Luke Sun (PhuraXylox@gmail.com) and Yunfei Zhang*/

1. Install ROS Hydro- full in Ubuntu 12.04
	Follow steps outlined by http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu
	Follow ROS tutorials to set up ROS_PACKAGE_PATH and  

2. Install Openni Camera and Openni Launch
	a) $sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-openni-camera
	b) $sudo apt-get install ros-<rosdistro>-openni-launch
	Documentation at: http://wiki.ros.org/openni_camera
			  http://wiki.ros.org/openni_launch

3. The people detection algorithm used is from pcl people namespace
	Link to pcl tutorial: http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/ground_based_rgbd_people_detection.php
	The people_detection package achieves the algorithm in ros using either a real Kinect launched by openni launch or a simulated kinect in Gazebo

	The program now gets the Kinect frame from ROS instead of openni grabber, it subscribes to the topic published by openni_launch camera/depth_registered/points, see ROS tutorial for more information, i.e. ros::spinOnce/ros::spin.
	The cloud_callback in the pcl code is replace by ROS callback, use pcl::fromROSMsg to convert PointCloud2 to PointT type.
	The code is hardcoded to order the PointCloud2 data, thus, only useable with Microsoft Kinect at 480x640 resolution, other cameras are not tested and other resolutions will not work.
	min_confidence, min_height, etc parameters are all default parameters, therefore need not be set, but set anyways for easy to access changing of parameters if needed.
	The node publishes to a topic called /people, includes z(depth) and x coordinates as well as an indicator which is used by the dual-navigation-goal nodes (can add more info later) of the first person detected with respect to the Kinect camera.

	The messages is only published if a set of requirements are met beforehand(at time of writing must see same person 3 times in a row, and does not publish if sees more than 1 person) to eliminate noise that may cause random navigation goals when the robot decides to move to the person.

	The dual navigation_goals package subscribes to the /people topic to send goals to the navigation stack whenever it detects a person.

	Built using rosbuild
	Packages dependencies: 
		roscpp, std_msgs, sensor_msgs, pcl_ros, pcl_conversions, pcl_msgs

	CMakeLists notes:
	target_link_libraries (ground_based_people_detector ${PCL_LIBRARIES} /usr/lib/libvtkFiltering.so) at the bottom of CMakeList to fix unusual link error

	
runtime: roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch
	 rosrun people_detection ground_based_people_detector
